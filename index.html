<p>Deep learning has sparked a new found interest in machine learning due to its ability to solve several types of tasks. There are large computational complexities associated with deep learning due to the size of datasets and the connections between data points. The most recent libraries use a combination of CPU and GPU computation to accelerate the deep learning algorithms. Most notably, this occurs during the training period. Double digit performance increases have been noted since the inclusion of GPUs in deep learning. However, since their inclusion, GPUs have grown in power consumption to meet computational demands. This has led to issues in reliability and cooling in data center applications. In order to strike a balance between power and performance, this paper aims to answer the holistic question of, “Are GPUs more energy efficient for deep learning algorithms?” We will include the cost of data transfer over PCIe from host to GPU, computation on the GPU, the pre and post processing of data done by the CPU, and the total time required for the algorithm.</p>

<p>For databases we will be using MNIST and FaceScrub. If we are able to measure the power costs associated with transferring data over PCIe we will also use SUN397 and COCO 2014 and 2015. </br> We will be using the REsNet-50 and FCN-8 networks. We will be using Caffe and Tensorflow. <br> For power measurements we will be using Intel Power Gadget, which accurately measures the power used by the CPU in real-time. </p>

<a id="Hardware" class="anchor" href="#Hardware" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hardware</h3>

<p>For hardware we have Vishnu's laptop with Intel i7-3630 QM and NVIDIA GTX 660M, Karim's laptop with Intel i7-6600U, NVIDIA Jetson K1, GPU Cluster 1 with a NVIDIA GTX 760, and GPU Cluster 2 with dual NVIDIA Titan X in SLI. GPU power measurements will be done on GPU Cluster 2, while CPU power measurements will be done on Vishnu's laptop. If additional CPU resources are needed we may use the CPUs in the two GPU Clusters. </p>
